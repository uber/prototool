// Protobuf Uber Style Guide
//
// This is the default style enforced with lint.
//
// There are places in this style guide that reference line places, i.e. the
// first line is always the syntax line, however for demonstration purposes,
// this is violated so we can comment on such style choices here.
//
// Topics not covered:
//
// - Extensions
// - Reserved keyword
// - Most options (message options, field options, etc)
// - Custom options

// Tab style is two spaces.
// Comments are always //, not /**/.

// The first line is always the syntax line. If there is a license header,
// this comes first, then a newline, then the syntax line.
//
// Syntax should always be "proto3".
syntax = "proto3";

// Imports come next.
// There is one newline between the syntax line and imports.
// Import lines have no newlines between them.
// The imports should be alphabetized.

// Google's Well-known Types come first. They should be used if appropriate.
// Google's well-known types should be directly imported from
// "google/protobuf" as shown.
import "google/protobuf/empty.proto";

// After the Well-Known Types, there is a newline followed by the other
// imports. The imports should be alphabetized.
import "dep/dep.proto";

package style.uber;

// Next are the package options.
// There is one newline between the package declaration and package options.
// Package options should be alphabetized.
// The below java and golang options are always specified.

// The go package is always $(basename PACKAGE)pb.
// Do not use the "long-form" package name with a directory path.
option go_package = "uberpb";
// The java package is always com.PACKAGE.pb.
option java_package = "com.style.uber.pb";

// Next come the definitions.
// There is one newline between the package options and the definitions.
// The preferred ordering is enums, messages, services.

// IMPORTANT
// 1. All enums have their name as a prefix to all values.
// 2. All enums have a zero value with suffix _INVALID.
// 3. Enums optionally have a one value with suffix _UNSET to denote a
// purposefully unset value, but if you think you will need to denote an
// actually null value over the wire, set this, as _INVALID is not a valid
// value to check against.
// (1) is necessary for C++ scoping rules, (2) is good for golang zero values.
// We prefer _INVALID instead of _NONE or _UNSET as it carries no intention.
// I.e. A programmer would not intentionally set the enum value to _INVALID.
// See FooType as an example.
//
// A longer explanation:
//
// Protocol buffers (v3+ to be specific) does not expose the concept of set vs.
// unset integral fields (of which enums are), as a result it is possible to
// create a empty version of a message and accidentally creating the impression
// that an enum value was set by the caller. This can lead to hard to find bugs
// where 'default' values (the 0 value enum option) is being set without the
// caller knowingly doing so. You may be thinking - but it is super useful to
// just be able to assume my default enum option, just like I want a field
// called count to default to 0 without setting it explicitly. The thing is,
// ENUMs are not integers, they are just represented as them in the proto
// description. Take for example the following enum:
//
// enum Shape {
//     SHAPE_CIRCLE = 0;
//     SHAPE_RECTANGLE = 1;
// }
//
// In this case a consumer of this proto message might forget to set any Shape
// fields that exist, and as a result the default value of 'Circle' will be
// assumed, this is dangerous and creates hard to track down bugs.
//
// The 1 numbered enum should be used for UNSET when this semantic is
// desired {ENUM_TYPE}_UNSET = 1.
//
// Following similar logic to our INVALID case, we don't want information in
// messages to be implied, we want signal to be stated with intention. If you
// have a case where you want UNSET to be a semantic concept then this value
// must be explicitly set. For example:
//
// enum TrafficLight {
//     TRAFIIC_LIGHT_INVALID = 0;
//     TRAFFIC_LIGHT_UNSET = 1;
//     TRAFFIC_LIGHT_GREEN = 2;
//     TRAFFIC_LIGHT_YELLOW = 3;
//     TRAFFIC_LIGHT_RED = 4;
// }
//
// It's tempting to use UNSET as a default value, but then again we risk the
// case of a user forgetting to set the value and it being interpreted as the
// intentional value 'UNSET'. For consistency across our protos if UNSET is
// a semantic value of your enum, it should be field value 1.

// FooType is a foo type, and wants to tell you what type of Foo it is.
enum FooType {
  // There should be no spaces between comments and values.
  // _NONE and _UNSET values should not have comments.

  FOO_TYPE_INVALID = 0;

// Foo is a foo, it goes around the world and talks to bars.

  // If there is a type enum associated with a message, the name of the
  // field should be "type", as is shown here, and it uses tag 1.

  // Type is the type of Foo.
  FooType type = 1;

  // https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#scalar
  // Use the "right" primitive type for the situation, regardless
  // of generated code in the particular target language.
  // For example, use uint32 for ports, not int32, uint64, int64, etc.

  // Note underscore, not CamelCase.

  double why_are_we_using_doubles = 2;

  // See, micros!
  //
  // Here an sint32 is used instead of int32 as this has a high probability
  // of having a negative value, and 32 bits instead of 64 as by definition
  // this will never exceed 32 bits.

  sint32 latitude_micros = 3;
  sint32 longitude_micros = 4;

  // Ids should be strings. Sometimes there are cases where repos have
  // had wrapper message types for ids, but it ends up providing not much
  // if any value in practice, and causes a lot of code uncleanliness when
  // developing.

}


// Nesting messages and enums is allowed, except for request/response
// messages (see below).
// For example, this appropriate in cases where the inner message
// has no meaning or purpose outside the scope of the outer message.
// NOTE: This affects the names of generated types and may add a great
// amount of verbosity.
// Perform this at your own discretion.

// In this example, Bar has an embedded type, and an ID.

// Bar is a bar that a Foo can talk to.
message Bar {
  // Note the fully-qualified prefix BAR_TYPE_.

  // Type is the type of Bar.
  enum Type {
    BAR_TYPE_INVALID = 0;

  // An ID field for a message should be the first tag, UNLESS
  // there is a type field, in which case it is the second tag.

  string id = 2;

  // Repeated fields use plural case.
  // Traditionally for Protobuf, repeated fields actually used singular
  // case, but this ends up being more confusing and few actually did this
  // in practice.

// ShowingOffBuiltInFieldOptions shows off built in field options.
